      <h1 class="faq-header">Can we rate watch parties?</h1>

      <p>
        FFN is currently working on a system for fans to be able to rate watch parties. Until this system is completely integrated into FFN the best way to rate watch parties is through a post on your teamâ€™s page. This will allow other fans to see your watch party review. We understand this is not ideal but please be patient while we continue to work towards the best way for you to find Where Your Fans At?
